Ohayo Sekai
Good Morning World

I don't know how far we have to go
I feel pain with every step I take
But I'll keep going forward 'til it's over
Still the view is more than I'd expect
So why do I feel emptiness?
The light of days tells me I will be ok

I hear something that's calling
From somewhere inside my chest

To the deepest of oceans
Out past the sunsets
There is no limit that we cannot cross
To each corner of the earth and sky

Ohayo Sekai
Good morning world
Let us fight the dark of impossible
And become legends
Wake your mind to the new odyssey (odyssey)
Step by step we're breaking the stone
Around our hearts that kept us in the dark

No matter how wrong they think I am
With my heart I follow every plan
To keep marching forward 'til it's over
Billions of ways that this could go
I'll choose the only one I know
In the end we are in this war together

Who am I to risk the past that I once knew
The rain won't wash away this weight I carry
Am I the hero or blissfully deranged?
Am I the savior or is this our last day?

The future ebbs and flows just like the tide
It is the water of our life

Ohayo Sekai
Good morning world
We'll swim through the sea of impossible
To find the future
Chase the light to the southern cross
Step by step we're lighting up the dark
Around our hearts that kept us far apart (woo)

Find a way to conquer the unknown
The mind is something you can hone
And your dreams can become reality
You are so much stronger than you think

Forward now tomorrow is calling
Each day is a new mystery
I can see the courage in your eyes
Living proof that we can survive
Yeah!

Ohayo Sekai
Good morning world
Let us fight the dark of impossible
And become legends
Wake your mind to the new odyssey (wake)
Step by step we're breaking the stone
Around our hearts that kept us in the dark
