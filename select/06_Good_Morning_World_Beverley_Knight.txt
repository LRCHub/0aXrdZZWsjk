Starting at the beginning in a history of pain
It's hard to realize, a dream I've fantasized for so long
Suddenly my position turns around within one day
A transformation came born with freedom's name

This brave new world I live in
Seems a little easier to face
This deep blue sea I swim in
Bears me up enough so I can float away

Hey hello good morning world
Yesterday's another girl
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
Morning came to right the wrong
Yesterday's another song
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life

Got a whole new religion, I got a change of scenery
And yet in different ways, nothing ceases to amaze me
I'm a whole new woman, in a different kinda way
Yet I remain unfazed my mind and body still un-swayed

This brave new world I live in
Never seems to hurt me anymore
This deep blue sea I swim in
Always seems to bring me to a safer shore

Hey hello good morning world
Yesterday's another girl
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
Morning came to right the wrong
Yesterday's another song
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life

Hello, good morning, how are you? Fine so fine
Hello good morning, how are ya doin'? Fine so fine
Hello good morning, how are you? Fine so fine
Hello good morning, how are ya doin'? Fine so fine

This deep blue sea I swim in
Always seems to bring me to a safer shore

Hey hello good morning world
Yesterday's another girl
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
Morning came to right the wrong
Yesterday's another song
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life

Hey hello good morning world
Yesterday's another girl
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
Morning came to right the wrong
Yesterday's another song
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life

Hey hello good morning world
Yesterday's another girl
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
Morning came to right the wrong
Yesterday's another song
Lovin' every minute of my life, my life
